# The Visa contactless protocol

The EMV protocol, named after its founding companies Europay, Mastercard, and Visa, serves as the global standard for in-store smartcard payments.
We will construct a Tamarin security model to conduct a formal analysis of a simplified iteration of the EMV protocol tailored for Visa contactless transactions. 
The primary objective of this lab is to enhance your skills in modeling and analysis, utilizing a real-world protocol deployed in over 2 billion payment cards and 40 million payment terminals across the globe. 
More specifically, you will gain proficiency in modeling 
(i) cryptographic mechanisms that incorporate both asymmetric and symmetric cryptography, 
(ii) communication channels with varying levels of security, 
(iii) diverse roles, and 
(iv) branching execution, akin to if statements in imperative languages.
